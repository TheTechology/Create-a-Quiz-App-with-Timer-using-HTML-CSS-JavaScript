Hello readers, Today in this blog you’ll learn how to Create a Quiz Application with Timer using HTML CSS &amp; JavaScript. Earlier I’ve shared a blog on how to Create a Responsive Personal Portfolio Website and now it’s time to create Quiz Web App using JavaScript.  In this program [Quiz App with Timer], there are three layers or boxes, and these boxes shown one by one on a particular button clicked. At first, on the webpage, there is shown a button labeled as “Start Quiz” and when you clicked on that button, then the info box appears with popup animation.  In this infobox, there are some rules of the quiz and two buttons labeled as “Exit” and “Continue”. When you clicked on the Exit button, the info box will be hidden but when you clicked on the Continue button, then the Quiz Box appears.
